I've worked in the #sg_hackathon-orgnizrs weekly hackathon: Hackathon Blossom (Flower Classification) https://www.kaggle.com/spaics/hackathon-blossom-flower-classification :hibiscus: :blossom: :rose: :cherry_blossom: :wilted_flower: :white_flower: :sunflower: :tulip: :bouquet: :hibiscus: :blossom: :rose: :cherry_blossom: :wilted_flower: :white_flower: :sunflower: :tulip: :bouquet: :hibiscus: :blossom: :rose: :cherry_blossom: :wilted_flower: :white_flower: :sunflower: :tulip: :bouquet: :hibiscus: :blossom: :rose: :cherry_blossom: :wilted_flower: :white_flower: :sunflower: :tulip: :bouquet:
It is a little bit difficult for me but I enjoy it! I would have needed much more time to try more different models too, but it is OK.
It's not the winning but the taking part that counts and I will do my best!
2. I'd like to encourage every member in the Hungarian study group to start or continue the 60-days-challenge!
